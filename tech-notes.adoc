== getAll from cache should never expire

== Asynch cache reload

== Ignite crash notes
* backups is only for PARTITIONNED
** no sense for REPLICATED
** at least until 2.7.0
** official documentation says so, BTW
*** https://apacheignite.readme.io/v2.7/docs/primary-and-backup-copies
** unlike near cache ?
*** https://apacheignite.readme.io/v2.7/docs/near-caches
*** But that is necessarily on heap (not off heap)

== Investigate cache + queue
* make your cache LOCAL
* don't automatically propagate changes
* replicate changes commands via topics
* each subscriber should apply the command to it's local copy of the cahe
** less headaches with frameworks internals
** no overhead of read operations due to ditributed architecture
** You can view it as CQRS where reads are done in local cache, and writes to distributed topics
